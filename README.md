Peek
================
Peek is a browser extension that lets you preview dozens of types of documents before you download them. Just hover over a file's link, and Peek will display an interactive preview of the file instantly. Peek also allows you to expand a preview to a new browser window for easier viewing.

Peek supports previews for the following file formats:

* PDF and RTF Files
* Word Documents (.doc, .docx)
* Excel Documents (.xls, .xlsx)
* PowerPoint Presentations (.ppt, .pptx)
* WebM, MP4, GIFV, and OGG/OGV Video
* Flash video files (.flv, .f4v)
* MP3 and WAV Audio

In addition to direct file links, Peek also supports previewing links to public Google Docs files, Imgur GIFV links, and Gfycat links.

_FLV playback supported by [F4Player](http://gokercebeci.com/dev/f4player)._
